    \section{Introduction}
    Motivations
    - Create models that have the potential to deliver high impact on an organisations performance
    - Many of these models fail to make an impact because you are unable to connect them to the right sources.
    - Connecting to the right data source is important so that the models train on the right data sets that represent the business problem and thereby improving their accuracy and also removing any bias they might display in production.
    - Data engineers and data architects are actually responsible for ensuring models get access to the right data.
    - The reality though is that they require advice and guidance from the data scientists to ensure this does become a reality
    - Knowing data architecture will also help plan projects in such a way.

    Important to plan ahead.
    Allows for notebook dreams to become highly impactful applications.

    Note: Data architecture is outside the core competency of a data scientists roles and responsibility.

    \section{Data Warehouse}
    
    \subsection{Introduction to Data Warehousing}
    A data warehouse is the single source of truth for the entire organisation.
    A data warehouse is generally used to store information from structured data sources.
    An organisation collects data from its operational databases and organises it inside a data warehouse, in a format you can perform analytics on.
    An operational database is one that holds transactions or data that is written by applications.
    Examples to consider.
    - Could have a web shop which collects its transactions in a sales database.
    - CRM which stores all information in a customer databse.............

    Could perform analytics directly on these operational databases.
    However, this will impact the performance of your applications.
    It will be detrimental to your business if you web shop is running slow, just because some data scientist was querying the data to explore the available features.
    It's also the case that operational database are designed to store transactions and are not easy to query for analytical purposes. (Pretty key point)
    Operational databases are designed to be written to, whereas analytical databases need to provide more read performance.
    Analytical databases perform better when the data is stored in a columnar format, whereas operational databases are designed for storing transactions in rows.

    Very key point.
    Makes a lot of sense for any organisation to extract data from all its operational databases and store it in a data warehouse,
    and store it in a way that makes it easy for querying by analysts and data scientists alike.

    Companies also enrich their data warehouse with data from external sources.
    Combine real time data from the internet with operational data.
