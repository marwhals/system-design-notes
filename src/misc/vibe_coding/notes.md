## What is Vibe Coding?

- See timeline

- Upside
  - .....
- Downside
  - Code requires a good level of review
  - Will implement exactly what you ask for i.e human is the problem here....again
  - Training data for LLMs is old
    - Can lead to out of data dependencies
    - Won't understand how new releases or new libraries work
    - May try an use deprecated methods or methods which have been removed XD
  - Refactoring method names and types can be slow
  - If it does not understand how to do something in the code it might leave a TODO in the code

### Will AI replace developers ermaherd

- Will still need to understand Software Engineering and the technology you are working with

### What is vibe coding

- Introduced by computer science Andrej Karpathy in Feburary 2025
  - Makes it easier for people without coding skills to create apps, websites or tools by focusing on the "vibe" or idea rather than the technical details

- The ugly
  - .....like you favourite app here
  - Working but cannot be considered usable
  - Can you deploy it an use it?
  - Is it secure?
  - Can you scale it?
  - Can you maintain it?
  - Can you fix it when things go wrong?

- The good
  - Expericende engineers can work fast
  - Tools need guidance
  - When challenged they can "hallucinate"
    - Solutions are counter intuitive and wrong
  - By following best practices you can guide AI to produce quality software
