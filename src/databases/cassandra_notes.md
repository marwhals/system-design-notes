## Apache Cassandra Overview

### Intro

- Apache Cassandra is a distributed, decentralised scalable and highly available NoSQL database i.e
  - Distributed / Multiple machines (Cluster)
  - Decentralised - No master slave, identical nodes and no single point of failure, high availability
  - Scalable - Add or remove nodes, little performance impact, no manual intervention (*check*), no manual balancing
- Apache cassandra use cases
  - Large and growing data
  - High availability is important
  - Changing data
  - Consistency is not a concern
- Faster writes
